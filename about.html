            <p>Rocky Mountain Explorer was founded in 2020 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who wanted 
            to make the mountains accessible to everyone. What started as a single van driving skiers from 
            Calgary to Banff has grown into a fleet of modern shuttles serving the entire province. 
            We believe that nature is for everyone. That’s why we offer affordable rates, student discounts, 
            and eco-friendly travel options. Our drivers aren't just chauffeurs; they are local experts who 
            know every hidden gem, viewpoint, and best coffee stop along the Icefields Parkway.</p>
