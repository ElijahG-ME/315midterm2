            <p class="italic">Rocky Mountain Explorer was founded in 2020 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who wanted 
            to make the mountains accessible to everyone. What started as a single van driving skiers from 
            Calgary to Banff has grown into a fleet of modern shuttles serving the entire province.
